# ECM2429-workshop-1-exercises
Python programming exercises

## Aims

Understand how to create Python classes and explore when to use them.

Understand the @property decorator.

Use PyTest framework to test objects.

Explore the design and testing of GUIs.

## Getting started

Copy this repository to a suitable working directory - it's often easier to work on your C: drive.

Install PyTest using Pip.  You might want to create a Python virtual env first.

```sh
pip install pytest
```

## Testing properties.py

1. Run the tests provided using the ```pytest``` command.

2. Replace print statements with logging calls.

3. Consider the failing test.  Can you fix the code.

4. Try changing name from John to Johnny. What happens?

5. Write a similar test for the age parameter, one that checks for negative values.

6. What happens if you give a floating point age? e.g. 12.5

7. How might the code be further improved?

## GUI programming calculator.py

1. Run the program.  You might need to install TkInter

2. Use the keys and observe the output.

3. Can you create a working calculator?

4. How can unit tests be used?

## Sample code

The file ```speech/record.py``` should help with the assignment.  It needs tidying up, and might not be complete.
